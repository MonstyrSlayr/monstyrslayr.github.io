        <p>What is an algorithm?</p>
        <p>An algorithm is simply a series of moves.</p>
        <p>A move is denoted by a letter and a turn direction.</p>
        <p>R is the Right face, U is the Up face, F is the Front face, etc.</p>
        <p>A turn direction is represented by nothing (clockwise 90Â°), a 2 (180Â°) or a ' (counterclockwise 90Â°).</p>
        <p>The algorithm you choose will be portrayed on the cube above, so don't worry about the logistics too much.</p>
