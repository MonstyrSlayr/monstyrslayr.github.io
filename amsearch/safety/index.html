            <h3>What is safety?</h3>
            <p>
                Safety is a welcoming, diverse, adaptive environment
                with a variety of educational opportunities, student downtime,
                and adults who can act as mentors.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What does it mean for a student to be unsafe?</h3>
            <p>
                A student can feel unsafe inside and outside of school.
                Factors like homelessness and poverty are major contributors
                to students feeling unsafe outside of schools. The student is
                more concerned with their financial situation than with learning.
                Other factors outside of schools are family drug abuse and violent home lives.

                But what about inside of the schools? Bullying and <a href="../discrimination">discrimination</a>
                both contribute to make students in schools feel unsafe. In the
                Kowalski v. Berkeley County Schools court case, a student was suspended
                for create a website for the purpose of harassment against another
                student.

                &emsp;&emsp;Despite seemingly extensive safety measures, a student was
                able to bring a loaded gun into Henry Clay High School. How was
                this possible?
            <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Henry Clay High School is an American public school located in Kentucky.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;As it turned out, the safety measures were not as thorough as 
                they seemed on the surface. At the school, when a student walked into
                the building, their bag would be searched by security to make sure the school
                remained safe. However, according to a student at Henry Clay High School,
                "some of them search the bags pretty well and then other ones look at them and they don't really care. Like they'll just open one pocket."
