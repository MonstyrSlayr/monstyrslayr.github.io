            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Despite seemingly extensive safety measures, a student was
                able to bring a loaded gun into Henry Clay High School. How was
                this possible?
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Henry Clay High School is an American public school located in Kentucky.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;As it turned out, the safety measures were not as thorough as 
                they seemed on the surface. At the school, when a student walked into
                the building, their bag would be searched by security to make sure the school
                remained safe. However, according to a student at Henry Clay High School,
                "some of them search the bags pretty well and then other ones look at them and they don't really care. Like they'll just open one pocket."
