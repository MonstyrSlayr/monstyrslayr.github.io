            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;If you are reading this, there is a good chance that
                you went to a public school. <u>Did you know that 90% of
                American students are currently enrolled in a public school?</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;For those of you who have been to a public school: How was it?
                How was your experience? Would you say that you enjoyed most of it?
                Disliked it? What would you say was your best experience at your school.
                <b>Stop skimming over the questions and really think about it.</b> Was 
                your public school experience a good time?
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;And for the 10% of you who did not go to a public school:
                Why not? What stopped you? (This is not an accusatory question, this is 
                just for the sake of knowledge.) Would you say the school you went to is better
                than a public school? How so? Was it just the better facilities? Did
                you have better teachers? What about the food?
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Over the course of the school year, I 
                researched the effect American public 
                schools have on its students. It shows 
                up directly in classrooms and affects 
                students indirectly after school and 
                even after graduation in college and 
                the workplace. (All schools affect 
                the mental health of students, whether 
                good or bad, but for the sake of my 
                research, I am only focusing on public schools.)
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;This problem is important because 
                the students in schools today will 
                be the leaders of tomorrow, so it is 
                crucial that they have the correct 
                facilities to deal with low mental health. 
                This website will explore the 
                facilities students are placed into, 
                how these schools affect students mentally, 
                and propose solutions to the low mental 
                health of students.
