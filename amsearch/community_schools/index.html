            <h2>What is a Community School?</h2>
            <p>
                If a student is concerned about their safety, they will be able to learn in school. 
                Many low-income families are extremely concerned with safety.
                Because of this, low-income students tend to perform worse in school than wealthy students.
                <br><br>
                <b>Community schools ensure that student safety does not get in the way of learning.</b>
            </p>

            <p>The Community Schools Forward task force has 6 key features that should make up an ideal community school, which are as follows:</p>

            <p>
                "Empowering student and family engagement,
                <br>
                Collaborative leadership, shared power, and voice,
                <br>
                Expanded and enriched learning opportunities,
                <br>
                Integrated systems of supports,
                <br>
                Rigorous, community-connected classroom instruction,
                <br>
                [and] A culture of belonging, safety, and care".
