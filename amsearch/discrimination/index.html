            <h2>What types of discrimination are present in schools?</h2>
                <div class="examples">
                    <h3>Racism</h3>
                        <p>
                            Racism is discrimination against an individual
                            due to their race, which is mostly determined
                            by skin color and ethnicity. Research shows that this type
                            of discrimination can show up as early as preschool.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Misogyny</h3>
                        <p>
                            Misogyny is discrimination against women. etc etc
                        </p>

                    <h3>Transphobia</h3>
                        <p>
                            Transphobia is discrimination against transgender people.

        <h2>Yale Research on Implicit Bias</h2>
        <div class="infoDivBody">
            <img src="img/bias.jpg" style="width:33%">
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Researchers at Yale found out that implicit bias in students
                can begin as early as preschool. Yale researchers conducted a study in which
                teachers were instructed to look at preschool students with the intent of finding
                challenging behaviors. The results they drew were astounding.
            <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;"Findings revealed that when expecting challenging behaviors teachers gazed longer at Black
                children, especially Black boys. Findings also suggested that implicit biases may differ depending
                on teacher race. Providing family background information resulted in lowered severity ratings
                when teacher and child race matched, but resulted in increased severity ratings when their race
                did not match." - from a brief from the Yale Child Study Center.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;This study proved that racial discrimination is an issue even
            in the early stages of school. But what exactly is implicit bias?
            <u>Implicit bias is bias that occurs automatically and accidentally.</u>
            The teachers in the study were unaware that they were being studied for
            implicit biases, which made the study more reliable and genuine - and significant.
        <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;"Black preschoolers are 3.6 times as likely to receive one or more suspensions
            relative to White preschoolers.
            This is particularly concerning as Black
            children make up only 19% of preschool enrollment, but comprise 47% of
            preschoolers suspended one or more times."
        <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;This is especially concerning, because it means behaviors seen
            in black preschoolers can be seen as condemning while the same behaviors seen
            in white preschoolers can be seen as normal.

        <h2>Lawsuit Against the Oakland School District</h2>
        <div class="infoDivBody">
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Up until 2012, schools in the Oakland District were
                suspending black boys at a significantly higher
                rate than white boys.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;"According to figures obtained by the Los Angeles
                Times, African-Americans accounted for 63 percent
                of students in the district with at least one
                suspension and 61 percent of those who were expelled,
                but make-up just 39 percent of the district's total
                enrollment."
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;As you can imagine, this issue is rooted in
                racism and has been investigated by federal monitors.
