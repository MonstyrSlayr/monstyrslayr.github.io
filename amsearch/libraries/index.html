        <h3><i>Melissa</i> by Alex Gino</h3>
        <div class="infoDivBody">
            <img src="img/melissa.jpg" class="inline">
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;<i>Melissa</i> has been challenged in libraries
                for having a 10 year old transgender protagonist. Many parents
                feel that their children should not be learning about gender
                and sexuality at such a young age.
            <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;"Several patrons of the Lincoln Parish Library in Ruston (LA) complained about George and Rick, two books in the children's room collection featuring LGBTQIA+ characters. The identical complaints referenced an upcoming mill levy election for the library. While the patrons agreed that neither book was sexually graphic, they expressed concern that children could encounter a topic the parents didn't want them to."
            <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;The book was originally titled <i>George</i>, but Gino realized that "The title of [the] book made it seem as though it is OK to use an old name for a person when they have provided you with a different name that works better for them." The title was changed to <i>Melissa</i> to reflect these thoughts.
            <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Due to these factors, <i>Melissa</i> has remained a
                controversial book in elementary school libraries.

        <h3><i>This Book is Gay</i> by Juno Dawson</h3>
        <div class="infoDivBody">
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;As the title suggests, <i>This Book is Gay</i> revolves
                around sexual education for queer identifying young adults. Despite being
                targeted away from, the book was banned for containing sexual
                imagery, under the argument that "books like [<i>This Book is Gay</i>] are 'obscene and pornographic' — as Henry McMaster, the Republican governor of South Carolina put it — and it is even suggested that authors are 'grooming' young people for deviant lifestyles."
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Dawson, the author of the challenged book, wrote an article about
                having written such a crittically acclaimed yet controversial book.
