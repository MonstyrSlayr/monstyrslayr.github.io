Feet for horns (or horns for feet?), a missing beak, too many eyes, plumeless wings - it all comes together to create an unsettling Epic that lacks the feathery charm of its Common cousin.

Epic Potbellies, however, take this protective instinct to new heights!  This territorial Elemental is perfectly pleasant... until an unwitting Monster tries to borrow its pot.  Trespassers cause the Epic Potbelly to transform from delightful daisy to snarling snapdragon, baring its fearsome fangs and flapping its mighty wings. Tragically, the stone reinforcements added to its pot make it much too heavy to fly anywhere.",b,b_epic

No seriously, those weights are pretty heavy, and it needs a spotter. This Monster is focused on self-improvement wherever possible, which sets it apart from the garden variety that's more than happy to remain languid and pudgy.

It gobbles them up at every opportunity, but thanks to a curious chemical reaction that takes place inside the Monster, they drift to its outer membrane and protrude at all angles. The Rare Toe Jammer's shifting coloration may be a product of this same internal process, but while some believe that this theory holds Water, others claim it's just a phase.",d,d_rare

The Rare Mammott is a Monster of a different color; it is a master of hide-and-seek and uses its stripes to camouflage seamlessly with its surroundings.

Then it's a simple matter of working together to 'animate' the tree's trunk and branches to give it a full range of motion. Each Gnarl operates the opposite side of the tree, and synchronously conjoin their tendrils to form a 'mouth' through which wind can blow to produce sound. Mercifully, the tree doesn't perceive this transformation as troublesome - instead, it delights in the opportunity to explore the Monster World and make music!

Is the Piplash harboring some secret, putting up a front, concealing a side we can't see? Could the Monster possibly be as wholesome as it outwardly seems? This is driving us crazy!!!",jkm,jkm

Put bluntly (and literally), this is the Monster equivalent of a brain fart: its home is a gargantuan brain and it communicates by spewing gas from its... mouth? Gut? We're not sure how to classify it. The biggest surprise, especially because of the presence of the Poison Element, is that the X'rt's gaseous emissions are totally odorless. Instead, they buildup over time and incite confusion and fogginess in the thought processes of its neighbors - so make sure you're not planning on doing anything mentally taxing when an X'rt is nearby.",jlm,jlm

The Quad-Element Whaill is the latter, so-named for the ululations that gurgle forth from its many mouths. Although at first blush these sounds seem melodious, over time they can elicit feelings of dread and disorientation in the listener. That's because the sound waves the Whaill produces actually begin to tear apart the fabric of space time and threaten to expose reality to the Rift, the world between worlds.

The Monster is constantly experimenting with the materials available to devise new gadgets and gizmos - not unlike the Celestial that shares its Elemental affiliation.

The Ethereal Quad's affinity for the Shadow Element causes an unusual sticky pink residue to form on its legs - something to do with the fact that they're so often bathed in darkness. Apparently this phenomenon has been known to happen at large scale, when the dark matter of the Rift between dimensions seeps out from interdimensional fractures. It could be a trick of light, but the gloom that dwells beneath a Pentumbra almost seems to take a life of its own... but because it's nothing more than a shadow of a shade, it tends to imitate other beings' sounds rather than create its own.",gjlm,gjlm

But what if we told you that in the midst of its nauseating display, it is actually performing a crucial function to preserve the ecosystem of the Workshop? Oogiddy traps Poisonous gasses within its bulbous body, mixing them with its own uniquely fragrant blend of acidic juices to neutralize all toxicity. The goopy byproduct created through this process ain't pretty, but it acts as a highly effective fertilizer (or hair gel!). Oogiddy even bids its fellow Monsters to steer clear of noxious substances by aggressively pulsating its chromatophores in warning.",jklm,jklm

The gargantuan BeMeebEth represents the pinnacle of Zarroë's mad tinkering and endless experimentation. The Ethereal Quint towers over the other denizens of the Ethereal Workshop, inspiring awe and apprehension in equal measure. Visible in its unstable composition are all five Ethereal Elements: Plasmic tentacles, Shadowy claws, Crystalline cartilage, pockmarked Poisonous spines, and the Mech-nical jaw that houses its mighty brain.

Hairionette firmly believes that its every move is predetermined, pulled along its life path by the skeins of fate. It is driven by its overwhelming need to find just who is pulling the strings, never pausing to wonder whether it is in fact the mastermind behind its own designs.

Owlesque's Major and Minor forms symbolize the false projection of ourselves that we present to others, and the true self that we keep concealed. Yet, neither form is any less lovely than the other: with a simple flip, both aspects of Owlesque are equally striking, offering an unsettlingly strigine elegance and eye-catching markings (if you know which eye to catch). For all its supposed trickery, this Paironormal's existence encourages radical acceptance of all aspects of ourselves, and its piercing eyes (both camouflaged and corporeal) dare you to believe that beauty is simply a matter of perspective.",i02,i02

""The 'Bogle' project has unfortunately been placed on indefinite hiatus. Thought we were really onto something, designing a creature that stored air within a solid globe on its back to produce its music. That would be its air supply as it sang forth. Alas, the plans for the Core Air Elemental didn't really come together the way we planned - the inflexibility of the globe makes inhalation and exhalation a challenge for Bogle, coupled with its intense weight requiring multiple legs slapdashedly added to support it. We're starting from scratch on this one, although we'll be keeping a few aspects - it'll be a vocalist, and we're all quite partial to the color scheme.""
Seemingly added much later, another Colossals notes have been scribbled in the margin:
""A fresh perspective on Bogle has rendered this Monster viable. Most importantly - no longer a vocalist. The rigid globe of the original has been swapped out for an elastic air sack. Now that that weight has been lifted, the load-bearing legs have been converted into tubes through which the air can flow. Preserved the original's distracted personality because it's charming, but added a few avian touches of the final Air Elemental (like furthers [sic] and claws) for good measure.",prm_03,prm_03

""Progress halted on the skittish specimen codenamed 'Lowb.' Subject initially showed encouraging signs of maturation and musical resonance, but the duration of these fails to meet performance targets. Internal structure of the subject's thoracic cavity was designed to house a flowering bud, but external stimuli cause an unanticipated hardening of the outer shell. As such, this model has been shelved. Disappointing news, as the hope was for this creation to be designated as the Core Elemental of Plant. Nevertheless, the work continues: a promising new design has been stabilized with the assistance of pottery and will be explored further.""
Seemingly added much later, another Colossal's notes have been scribbled in the margin:
""Cancellation of the Lowb prototype was premature. Using the Dish-Harmonizer, I was able to harness the subject's shell hardening ability to fashion a dendritic structure composed of elder specimens on which the juvenile specimen can bounce. A constant cycle of renewal is now underway, in which old becomes reabsorbed and born anew. I knew this idea had potential, it just needed a few tweaks: now the Plant Primordial has a new lease on life.""",prm_01,prm_01

Especially at the beginning of the lunisolar year, it will wriggle its way over to its fellow Wublins, imitating the movements of the fantastical Lion creature of legend, and 'pluck the greens' to bring good fortune - this consists of pinching or squeezing any body part that is liable to produce a tickling sensation!",u20,u20_rare

Truth is, each is symbiotically connected to the other and equally responsible for delivering punchy kick patterns peppered with a little bottom-end bulk.

Its berries - should one be so foolish as to sample them - taste like cinnamon mayonnaise mixed with ham cola and profound regret. The leaf-like appendage atop its noggin acts as a handy parasol, protecting it from inclement weather and some of the more peculiar atmospheric emissions endemic to Wublin Island.

The dome that previously enclosed its eyes and 'soft parts' has shattered, its tentacles were replaced by carcinized limbs, and the Rift portal has morphed into what is now referred to as the Mega Rift. The near-impossible physics of Anglow have been taken to the extreme in the Mega Rift, flashing unusual symbols against an endless void of stars and darkness. Another dramatic difference is the skeletal arms holding the Anglow's lures now grasp at nothingness, and it is now the Epic Mythical's eyes that radiate with sound and light. This pulsing illumination is essential to navigate the darkness of the Monstriana Trench, but does little to deter the onset of Riftstalk growths over the Monster's body. An extra-torustrial fungus invasive to the Monster World, Riftstalk has nevertheless integrated into the ecosystem of the deep-sea ditch, and even became a food source for Glimmerglaws, bringing about its crustacean's unique coloration.",p06,p06_epic

It has rescued countless turkey dinners from burnt ends in the process.",t07,t07
Glaishur,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Glaishur,Celestial&,,"Glaishur's rebirth has given it a perspective on life that is as new and bright as freshly fallen snow. The cheerfully chill Celestial is embracing its newfound joie de vivre by taking up a creative hobby: snow sculpture! Many of this frosty giant's oeuvres are meticulously sculpted in the image of the Cold Elementals who revere it, but these Monsterpieces do not last long. Once a sculpture is complete, it is then toppled and molded anew, representing an eternal circle of life.",t08,t08
Blasoom,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Blasoom,Celestial&,,"The Blasoom has emerged from its ancient shell like a flower blossoming in the early days of spring, feeling refreshed and vibrantly alive. A surprising development in the Celestial's renewal was the disappearance of one of its elegantly oaky legs. While countless botanists and horticulturalists of the Plant Element have researched this loss of limb, the biological explanation behind its late leg growth remains elusive. The Blasoom appears undeterred however, happily hopping from place to place.",t09,t09
Syncopite,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Syncopite,Celestial&,,"Syncopite is a Diamond in the rough: unpolished and unrefined, yet glistening with an immense potential concealed inside its crude frame. The rugged Celestial has a surprisingly magnetic personality, capable of uniting its fellow Monsters and forging rock-solid friendships. Unfortunately, this inherent magnetism can be troublesome for the mineralized Monster, whose thoughts are frequently interrupted by the sudden collision of stones against its crystalline cranium.",t10,t10
Vhamp,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Vhamp,Celestial&,,"There’s nothing like a good tune-up for the Mech Celestial! Vhamp’s revival was like a cosmic car wash, removing centuries of rust and rubble to reveal a shining new Monster beneath. Movin’ and shakin' like a well-oiled machine, Vhamp now spends its days making repairs to the broken down Island it calls home, collecting shiny scraps all the while.",t11,t11
Adult Galvana,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Adult_Galvana,Celestial&,,"Energized by the Electrical currents that crackle at its finger (and toe) tips, adult Galvana has found a healthy outlet through physical activity. The Celestial of Electricity has grown into a star athlete capable of impressive orb control and unparalleled stamina. Galvana is a natural leader with a strong sense of sportsMonship, proudly taking on a team captain role and guiding its fellow Monsters with words of encouragement and motivation. It's the MVP of any Monster orchestra!",t12,t12_adult
Adult Scaratar,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Adult_Scaratar,Celestial&,,"No longer forced to lay its trademark instrument on the ground, the Scaratar fastidiously infuses wood with special toxins that transform it into a more ornate version. At this age, the Celestial of Poison is perhaps a little too preoccupied with superficially being an indicator of quality, and will often fixate on polishing its instrument rather than practicing its arpeggios.",t01,t01_adult
Adult Loodvigg,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Adult_Loodvigg,Celestial&,,"Perhaps it's motivated by some sense of latent rebelliousness, or maybe it was just time for a change, but the adult Loodvigg has embraced the exact opposite of Shadow - Light! It grafts gleaming gems onto the teeth of its keyboard, coiffs its hair, cuffs and ruff, and prioritizes flashy and flamboyant flourishes in its musical performance.",t02,t02_adult
Adult Torrt,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Adult_Torrt,Celestial&,,"Everything is sunshine and good vibes for the adult Torrt - it bleaches its hair to achieve a constant state of beach readiness - but is it all just a veneer masking self-doubt and feelings of unworthiness? Nah, this Celestial's got the right Attitorrt.",t03,t03_adult
Adult Plixie,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Adult_Plixie,Celestial&,,"For a Monster whose brain is so prominently on display, the adult Plixie sure is fixated on physical gains. During this period, it focuses almost exclusively on bulking up its arms, and drawing further attention to them by decorating them with temporary tattoos. The arms get so swole that they weigh down the Plixie, making flight nearly impossible - all while conspicuously skipping leg day.",t04,t04_adult
Adult Attmoz,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Adult_Attmoz,Celestial&,,"Some have accused Attmoz of being a bit of a windbag at this stage, but that's only because the Celestial talks nonstop about its new favorite topic: glam rock. The gestural skills used to play its trademark instrument have a number of other uses as well; using its hands to swipe and streak through the air, it’s now a master of karate (and friendship) for everyone. Ah-AH-ah!",t05,t05_adult
Galvana,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Galvana,Celestial&,,"Even the mightiest of Celestials has to start somewhere! The revived Galvana enjoys its new found freedom from age-old responsibilities, blissfully unaware that its very own creations roam the Monster World. Unshackled from the burdens of guardianship, Galvana instead releases its raw Electrical energy through play, even toying with the very orb that contains its power.",t12,t12
Scaratar,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Scaratar,Celestial&,,"While Scaratar may reign over the element of Poison, the serene Celestial wouldn't hurt a Humbug. The only thing that this pacifist prods with its surprisingly venomous forelegs is its instrument, whose harmonious sound echoes throughout the Monster World like an antidote coursing through the body. Despite its tranquil nature, it's certainly wise not to sneak up on a Scaratar: if it pricks you by surprise, you may be left with an embarrassing case of Tweedle Pox.",t01,t01
Loodvigg,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Loodvigg,Celestial&,,"Loodvigg’s skeletal visage may suggest it lacks a pulse, but take the time to revive it, and you will find that the Celestial of Shadow is very much alive! This peculiar pianist is a role model for all startling Shadow Elementals that feel misunderstood by their peers. Though Loodvigg’s appearance may chill onlookers to the bone, inside lies a creative soul capable of elegant self-expression through the gentlest caress of its keys. Sadly, the occasional mood swing can lead the adolescent Celestial to be a little forceful with its keyboard - hence the braces.",t02,t02
Torrt,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Torrt,Celestial&,,"Torrt is the rock that all Earth Elementals lean on: dependable, unwavering, and grounded. The steady beat of its drum actively defies the laws of physics, resonating throughout the Monster World and within each Earth Elemental regardless of distance or acoustics. This enduring rhythm has been harnessed by the Monsters for many surprising purposes, including lulling rambunctious young Monsters to sleep.",t03,t03
Plixie,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Plixie,Celestial&,,"Like the Plasma Element it represents, the pudgy Plixie's cranium contains a viscous ooze that floats and sways hypnotically within its container. While the joy of revival has made this buzzy Celestial a bit of a party Monster, its head's passing resemblance to a lava lamp should be disregarded. But please - if its Plixie Glass cap falls off while headbopping to its favorite tune, help scoop the goop!",t04,t04
Attmoz,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Attmoz,Celestial&,,"The Attmoz has long dreamt of strumming the strings of a physical instrument like its Celestial cousin Scaratar. Unfortunately this virtuoso suffers from a lack of binocular depth perception, making fine motor skills a challenge. Remaining as flexible and fluid air, this one-eyed wonder has risen above its limitations and adapted an instrument that harnesses the very essence of the element it reigns over. The Air Celestial's strength in the face of adversity has made it a symbol of perseverance for all Air Elementals.",t05,t05

Phosphoran Phlox,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Phosphoran_Phlox,Light&,,"Stirred by the Monster denizens of Light Island, the Phosphoran Phlox has arisen! Is this entity the flower or the Monster? In short, it's both... and it's neither. The true nature of the Titansoul is complex: it's a physical manifestation of the 'soul' of the Phosphora Titan, but it also appears to have a life-force distinct from its Titanic host. Light Island Monsters play a vital role in its inspiriting, conferring Soul'er Power by 'Linking' to the Titansoul and progressively raising its power level. The Phosphoran Phlox is silent, but as its Soul'er Power grows, it is able to exercise astounding musical control over its environment: manipulating the Aurora Monstralis overhead, conjuring dazzling light effects along the Titan's brow, and transforming nodules into musical lamps!
Phosphora's desire to join in the song is no doubt inspired by its mentor's admiration of the Colossals' musical gifts, and the Phosphoran Phlox helps to cement the Titan's place in the Monster World.",x18,x18
Cruv'laaphtian Crocus,https://mysingingmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Cruv%27laaphtian_Crocus,Psychic&,,"Stirred by the Monster denizens of Psychic Island, the Cruv'laaphtian Crocus has arisen! The distinction between 'flower' and Monster is blurred ever further in the physiology of this Titansoul - it's as if they have been fused into one entity with little sense of where one ends the other begins. It's unmistakably connected to the soul of the Psychic Titan, though - writhing tentacles reconstituted as roots and claws alike, brain matter coursing with synaptic action, and critter-like eyes it manipulates like juggling balls! One gets the ominous sense during its performance 'conducting' the Island's music that it is straining to pull itself out of the ground and float upwards into the endless Beyond. Perhaps its musical manipulation of the larger eyes, tentacle electrocutions and streaking meteor showers represent its attempts to destabilize the island and dislodge itself from the ground. Alas, Cruv'laapht is far too clever for that. Even though it will likely never tire of its ambition to break free and explore the cosmos, the Crocus is content to embody the musical aspirations of Cruv'laapht, and cements the Titan's place in the Monster World.",x15,x15
