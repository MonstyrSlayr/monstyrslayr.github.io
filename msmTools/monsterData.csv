No, these are neither Blubberflies nor Algaernons - they are the product of this paranoid Epic Mythical's overactive imagination, brought to life accidentally via a surfeit of dreamcraft. Our best guess is that the Epic Cherubble sought to imagine itself a shell to protect itself from these frightful friends, but it proved to be a suitable home for them instead! Nevertheless, a constant state of being on edge is what has helped this unlikely combination of misfits to survive near the volatile hydrothermal vents where the living ocean and core meet. This fascinating specimen has also helped to untangle some of the knots in the multi-Class Playbackyderm family by highlighting a phenomenon exclusive to the Monster World - inspirational evolution.

This Rare Dreamythical is specifically inspired by the 'bootle' breed of Pinghound, which itself has a long and storied history. Folklore states that the very first exemplar of the breed was dyed key-lime green in order to make it visually distinct (although this inadvertently led to some targeted fur loss). Over time, this shade of green faded in intensity, and an additional pair of legs sprouted out, distinguishing the breed further.

One gets the ominous sense during its performance 'conducting' the Island's music that it is straining to pull itself out of the ground and float upwards into the endless Beyond. Perhaps its musical manipulation of the larger eyes, tentacle electrocutions and streaking meteor showers represent its attempts to destabilize the island and dislodge itself from the ground. Alas, Cruv'laapht is far too clever for that.
